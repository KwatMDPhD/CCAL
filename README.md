# Naming conventions

## Please follow the guidelines below to make an organized package:
#### Comment with a full sentence.
#### Name accurately and precisely.
#### Use less acronym and more full word for variable names and function namesâ€”it's okay if it's long (e.g. fname --> filename & mtrx --> matrix & fp --> file_path)
#### A (n x m) matrix consists of n features and m samples.

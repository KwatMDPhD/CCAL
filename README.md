# See big picture

CCAL itself doesn't have much code. Instead, CCAL uses other cool libraries as submodules in `ccal/`, and import their awesome functions inside `ccal/__init__.py`'.

# Get started

Look at `notebooks/ccal.ipynb`, the boilerplate to use the CCAL library.

# Note

CCAL needs matplotlib>=2.0.2

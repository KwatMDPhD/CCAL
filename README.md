# See big picture

CCAL itself doesn't have much code. Instead, CCAL uses other cool libraries as submodules in `ccal/`, and import their awesome functions inside `ccal/__init__.py`'.

# Install

In Terminal:
```sh
pip install ccal
conda install --channel r rpy2 r-mass
conda install --channel r r-base=3.3.1
```
